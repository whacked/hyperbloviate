node electron <--> emacs with sibilant

* setting up robotjs

  Getting this to work was a highly confusing and tricky affair.

  as-is, it's very easy to get get error like "Module version mismatch. Expected 49, got 47."

  what seems to have worked in the end was this:

  ref "Installing modules and rebuild for Electron"
  on https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md#manually-building-for-electron

1. prepare =electron-rebuild=

=npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild=

this creates

=node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild= /in this project's base directory/

2. make sure you rebuild robotjs using electron-rebuid

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval never
     npm install # install deps
     cd node_modules/robotjs
     rm -rf build # remove it if it exists already
     cd -
     ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
   #+END_SRC

on completion it just says

=v Rebuild Complete=

and then it seems to work.

a quick check can be done using =node -e 'require("robotjs")'= (system node);
then do a require in =main.js= to test electron's =require=
